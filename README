Project-Information
-------------------
Hey, I want to program a simpel Desktop Application in the programming language golang.
I have not much experience and this is my first bigger project, I hope I can learn something.
-------------------
Application Features:
  - show momentary money balance in one big counter on the start page
  - saves the money balance on the computer
  - but also show bank balance and cash money separately
  - type in income and outcome easily with categories (food, clothes,...)
  - and whether the money is transfered to/apart from the bank account or cash money 
  - show money balance in a timeline with statistics
  - show in a pie chart on what categorie you spent the most money and from what categorie
  you have the biggest income
  - not overloaded and simple
Why GitHub?
  - to track the process and for a better structure
Goals:
  - have fun :D and learn more about golang
